# Changes

## Unreleased

### Phase 1 — pure core

- `to.etc.pdp11.core.addr`: `MemoryAddressType` and an immutable `Address` record.
  `withWidth` carries the I/O page rebasing rule — addresses below the I/O page are
  width-invariant, addresses inside it are rebased because the page sits at the top of memory
  and the top moves — and refuses to narrow an address that would not fit rather than
  truncating it. Round-trip tested across every pair of widths over the whole 8 KB I/O page.
- `to.etc.pdp11.core.bits`: `BitfieldDef`, `BitfieldsDef`, `BitfieldsDefs`. Address lookup is
  keyed on the canonical 16-bit form instead of the Pascal's linear scan that rewrote stored
  addresses in place, so a definition linked under one machine is still found under a machine
  of a different width. Overlapping and duplicate fields are now rejected.
- `to.etc.pdp11.core.disas`: `Disassembler`, `DecodedInstruction`, `MemoryImage`. The
  `PAnsiChar` pair the Pascal takes existed only for the retired `PDP11DISAS.DLL` ABI and is
  gone.
- `to.etc.pdp11.core.util`: `Logger`/`LogChannel` (channels, not severities — the Log window
  shows one column each, which is what makes a byte-level serial conversation readable),
  `ProgressMonitor`, `OperationCancelledException`, and `Octal.digitsForBits`.
- **Disassembler cross-checked against SimH over all 65536 words**, via
  `tools/gen-disas-corpus.sh`; the corpus is committed so the test needs no SimH. Every
  disagreement was settled by assembling the disputed instruction with `macro11`, an
  independent implementation of the same encoding.
  - Two bugs in the Pascal are **not** reproduced: `SPL` reads its level from bits 8..6 instead
    of 2..0 — and since those bits are part of SPL's own opcode it prints `SPL 2` for every SPL
    — and float operands mask the accumulator field to 2 bits, so `CLRF AC5` prints as
    `CLRF AC1`. `macro11` assembles `CLRF AC5` to `170405`, which settles it.
  - Two bugs in SimH are **not** adopted: `000256` and `000276` each duplicate the previous
    entry in the condition-code group; correct decodes are `CLN CLZ CLV` and `SEN SEZ SEV`.
- `tools/pascal-disas-diff.sh` diffs this disassembler against the Pascal over all 65536 words.
  It reports 183 differing words and no others, word counts included: the 7 `SPL` words and
  176 float-operand words above. It is a hand-run check, not a committed test — a regression
  test pinned to an implementation with known bugs would pin the bugs.
- `tools/gen-disas-corpus.sh` documents how to get SimH's `pdp11` to start when it is linked
  against a `libvdeplug.so.2` that is no longer packaged under that name.

### Phase 0 — scaffolding

- Maven multi-module skeleton: `pdp11-core`, `pdp11-ui`, `pdp11-app`, targeting Java 21.
- Maven wrapper pinning Maven 3.9.11; the enforcer refuses anything below 3.9.
- The `pdp11-core` headlessness rule is enforced at compile time with
  `--limit-modules java.base` and again by an ArchUnit test. Both were verified to fail on a
  deliberately planted Swing reference.
- FlatLaf shell: `Pdp11Gui.main()` opens an empty `MainWindow` with a menu bar.
- GitHub Actions build on Linux, Windows and macOS.
- `Octal` formatting and parsing in `pdp11-core`, with tests.
- Machine descriptions recovered from the PDP11GUI 1.48.6 MSI installer and committed under
  `pdp11-app/src/main/resources/machines`: `pdp11.ini` and the eight `*.modules` m4 libraries
  it includes. These are not in the Pascal repository. See
  `pdp11-app/src/main/resources/machines/README.md`.
